#note1
Click the _setting_ Tab of _gethub_ web, scroll to _github pages_  , choose _master_ or _gh-pages_ , there will embody different result.
*If I choose a _theme_ which is provided by github pages, it will generate a _README.md_ automaticly in _master branch_.
*The _README.md_ file contains all the content about this theme, what I need is to make some change at corresponding part.
*If I choose _master branch_ at _setting_ Tab, that will make an effect of this theme, when I access this website.
+If I create a _gh-pages_ branch, and choose it at _setting_ Tab, in fact the _gh-pages_ is the default choice when it exists.
+Of course, I should create a _index.html_ file in _gh-pages_ as the default web entrance page.
+This will make the theme I choose before make no effect, because it is in _README.md_ file. The web begins with _index.html_.
So if I want to use the theme and also I don't want to use _master branch_, I need to copy the content of _README.md_ to _index.html_.
#note2
Things happen, it does not show as I wish. May be I ignore the other file generated at the same time with _README.md_. I will research it later.
#note3 
I create a new file _CNAME_ and write the top-level domain _jfang.tech_ into it. And then, it works. When I try to visist _yujinan.github.io/jfang_ , it redirect to _jfang.tech_.
The other thing I need to do is to bind ???
